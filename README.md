# CC4A: costs and adoption of climate adaptation practices in Africa

Carbon Credits 4 Adaptation (CC4A) needs two numbers for every adaptation
practice it might finance: what it costs to establish on a hectare of African
farmland, and what share of farmers actually take it up. This repository is
the machinery that reads those numbers out of the published literature and
hands them to the project's financial model as a spreadsheet.

Seven steps, each one a folder under `R/`, numbered in running order. A
search against OpenAlex, a duplicate pass, an abstract level scope decision, a
full text download, an extraction that quotes the paper rather than
paraphrasing it, a mapping onto controlled vocabularies, and an Excel export
carrying its own quality score.

Everything is R. Nothing in a script decides anything analytical: the
practices, the units, the search terms and the scope window are all read from
files at run time, so widening the review is an edit to a table rather than a
rewrite.

A word on why the design is cautious. These numbers end up multiplied by
hectares and by years inside a financial model, where nobody will be able to
see which paper a figure came from. A plausible looking wrong number is
therefore the expensive failure, and most of what follows is arranged to make
that failure noisy rather than silent.

## 1. What the pipeline does

| Step | Folder | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `R/01_search` | Keyword blocks are crossed into queries and sent to the OpenAlex works API. Africa and the publication window are filtered on the server, so only a plausible result set is ever downloaded. Each row remembers which query found it. |
| 2 | `R/02_dedup` | The result set collapses to one row per study. DOIs settle most of it; a fuzzy title comparison catches the rest. Rows that lose are not deleted, they are registered with the reason. |
| 3 | `R/03_screen` | A model reads title and abstract and answers whether the study is worth downloading: does it carry a number, is the subject an adaptation practice, is it set in Africa, is it inside the window. Code then audits the answer and sends the doubtful cases to a person. |
| 4 | `R/04_fetch` | Full text, chased through Unpaywall, then the DOI, then the publisher. Downloads are inspected before they are trusted, because a login page saved as a PDF is still a PDF. |
| 5 | `R/05_extract` | A model reads the paper and returns parameter rows in the paper's own words: the number, the unit as written, the page, the sentence. Code then looks for each sentence on the page it was attributed to. Anything it cannot find is discarded. |
| 6 | `R/06_harmonise` | Verified rows are mapped onto the controlled vocabularies and the units are made comparable. Lookup tables do most of it, a cache does the rest, and one batched model call handles the remainder. |
| 7 | `R/07_publish` | The Excel parameter database in schema order, a provenance sheet, a sheet of rows worth a second look, the bill for the run, and the score against the gold set. |

A diagram of this belongs in `docs/workflow_diagram.md`, which currently holds
the same seven steps as a sketch.

## 2. What is in this repo and what is not

The repository carries scripts and the small tables those scripts read. It
carries no papers, no run output and no credentials.

| Here | Not here |
|---|---|
| `R/`, every script | Downloaded full texts, which land in `outputs/04_fulltext/pdf/` |
| `catalogues/`, the vocabularies, keyword list, gold set and decision cache | Everything under `outputs/`, git ignored and rebuilt by the scripts |
| `docs/protocol.md`, the review protocol | `catalogues/search_raw.csv`, the raw result set, rebuilt by step 1 |
| `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`, notes for AI coding sessions | API keys, which live in `.Renviron` and are git ignored |

Layout is settled in one file, `R/00_shared/paths.R`. Scripts locate the
repository root from their own position using `rprojroot`, so the clone can
sit anywhere and no script has to change directory to work. Point
`CC4A_OUT_DIR` at a shared drive in `.Renviron` if run output should not live
inside the clone.

## 3. Folder by folder

### R/00_shared

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `paths.R` | Every folder and every file the pipeline touches, named once. Also the publication window (`YEAR_MIN`, `YEAR_MAX`) and the list of African country codes, since both are scope decisions rather than code. Creates the output folders the first time it is sourced. Every other script begins by sourcing it. |
| `utils.R` | The shared plumbing: timestamped logging, flag parsing, a single HTTP fetcher that carries the delay and the retry logic, CSV reading and writing that never guesses a column type, and one canonical way to normalise a DOI or a title before comparing it. |
| `vocab_cache.R` | A memory of every mapping from a verbatim extract to a controlled value. Reruns of step 6 therefore reproduce themselves and cost almost nothing. Each entry is stamped with a fingerprint of the option list it was chosen from, so enlarging a vocabulary expires exactly the decisions it invalidates and leaves the others standing. Corrections made by hand in the cache file are respected. |
| `install_packages.R` | Installs what the pipeline needs. Run once after cloning. |

### R/01_search

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `openalex_search.R` | Assembles queries from `catalogues/keyword_list.R`, sends them with the Africa and year filters applied server side, walks the results with a cursor, rebuilds each abstract from the inverted index OpenAlex returns, and records the query alongside every row. Picks up where it left off. `--block=` runs a single outcome block, `--limit=` keeps a trial small, `--dry` shows the queries and their expected yield without fetching. |

### R/02_dedup

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `dedup_results.R` | DOIs first, then a Jaro-Winkler comparison of titles for rows with no DOI or a disagreeing one. Comparison is blocked by year and first author, which keeps it affordable on a large set. Where two rows describe one study the survivor is chosen by rule: a DOI beats no DOI, an open access link beats none, a longer abstract beats a shorter one. `--threshold=` moves the title distance, `--report` writes the register without touching anything else. |

### R/03_screen

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `screen_scope.R` | The abstract level decision. Returns a verdict of in, out or unsure, a reason, the criterion that failed, the phrase evidencing a cost or adoption figure, the phrase naming the country, a guess at the practice, and a confidence. Picks up where it left off. `--limit=` for a trial, `--shard=k/n` to run in parallel, `--reask=` to revisit a named list, `--dry` to price it first. |
| `screen_rules.R` | The audit over those verdicts. Publication year and the Africa check are settled here from the record metadata rather than by the model, which is what makes the window cheap to move: two numbers in `paths.R` and a rerun, with no abstract read twice. A verdict of in whose quoted phrase contains no digit drops to unsure, as does anything the model marked low confidence, and a one word reason goes on the list to be asked again. Entries in `catalogues/screen_overrides.csv` override both the model and the rules. Writes the manual review queue. |

### R/04_fetch

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `fetch_fulltext.R` | Works down four routes per record: the open access location Unpaywall reports for the DOI, the open access URL the search already carried, the DOI itself, then the publisher's landing page. A download survives only if the magic bytes say PDF, `pdftools` can open it, it holds real text rather than scanned images, and it runs past a single page. A record is labelled paywalled only once all four routes have failed, never on the strength of one refusal. `--retry` revisits failures, `--dry` reports the plan. |

### R/05_extract

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `extract_verbatim.R` | Handles one paper. The page tagged text goes out once, and each parameter family (cost, adoption, carbon share) is asked about after it, so the provider's cache carries the document and the several calls cost barely more than one. Answers come back with a page and a sentence attached, and code then hunts for that sentence: on the cited page, elsewhere in the paper, or nowhere. The last case is thrown out and survives only in the audit file. A list of figures that can never be a parameter (a programme budget, an exchange rate, a yield) is enforced in code. The untouched model response is saved per record, so a disappointing run can be diagnosed without being paid for twice. |
| `run_corpus.R` | Drives the extractor across the corpus, taking only records that passed screening and yielded readable text. `--dry` measures real page sizes and prices the run before any of it is spent, `--practice=` narrows it, `--limit=` trials it, `--redo` forces a repeat. A broken PDF is caught and logged rather than allowed to end the run. |

### R/06_harmonise

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `harmonize.R` | Works from the verified rows alone and never reopens a paper. Practice, unit, geography and study design are mapped onto their controlled values: the synonym lists settle most of it, the decision cache settles what it has seen before, and a single batched model call handles the remainder. Units are made comparable here, with local currency converted at the study year rate and deflated to the base year, and with person-days deliberately left as labour rather than priced. Where nothing fits, the row is marked NOT STATED, the cell is left empty, and the unmatched term goes on a list for the team instead of into the data. |

### R/07_publish

| Script | What it is |
|---|---|
| `export_results.R` | Writes the parameter database in schema order, a provenance sheet carrying page, sentence, table reference and the pre-conversion value and unit, and a third sheet of rows that deserve a human glance. Also scores the run field by field against the gold set, so no release goes out without a number attached to its own reliability. |
| `cost_report.R` | What has been spent on model calls and what the remaining corpus would cost, computed from prompt sizes already observed rather than from guesses. `--forecast` prices what is left. Worth running before a full extraction rather than after one. |

### catalogues/

Reference tables, read at run time. No analytical rule is written into a
script.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `keyword_list.R` | The search vocabulary in four blocks: practice terms grouped by practice code, then cost, adoption and carbon terms. A query is one practice group against one outcome block. |
| `vocab_practices.csv` | Practice codes with a definition, every spelling the literature uses, whether the practice can support a carbon claim, and a boundary note saying where a borderline paper should go instead. |
| `vocab_units.csv` | Unit codes, the dimension each belongs to, what it standardises to, and how the conversion is meant to work. |
| `vocab_decisions.csv` | The harmonisation cache, written by step 6 and reused by it. Corrections made by hand survive the next run. |
| `screen_overrides.csv` | Screening decisions made by a person. They outrank everything else. |
| `gold_set.csv` | Records extracted by hand, used to score the pipeline in step 7. |
| `search_raw.csv` | The raw result set. Git ignored, rebuilt by step 1. |

### docs/

`protocol.md` sets out the question, the scope criteria and the method for
each stage, and closes with the questions still unsettled.
`workflow_diagram.md` is where the one page figure will go.

### outputs/

Git ignored and disposable; the scripts rebuild it. One folder per step, plus
`review/` for the queues people work from and `logs/` for the record of what
each run called and what it cost.

### .claude/ and CLAUDE.md

Notes for AI coding sessions on this repository: the standing rules, the
anatomy every script follows, the traps worth knowing, and a walkthrough for
adding a practice. Not needed to run anything.

## 4. The extraction schema

These are the columns of the Excel parameter database. The set is defined
once, as `SCHEMA_FIELDS` in `R/05_extract/extract_verbatim.R`, and published
in the order given by `SHEET_PARAMETERS` in
`R/07_publish/export_results.R`.

| Column | What goes in it | Controlled |
|---|---|---|
| `parameter` | `adoption_rate`, `cost_total`, `cost_installation`, `cost_variable`, `carbon_share` | yes, fixed list |
| `definition` | Free text. What is being measured, in the paper's own terms | no |
| `practice` | `agroforestry`, `conservation_agriculture`, `improved_fallows`, `biochar`, `cover_crops`, `drought_tolerant_varieties`, `water_harvesting`, `other` | yes, `vocab_practices.csv` |
| `value` | The number as the paper reports it | no |
| `unit` | `%`, `USD/ha/yr`, `UGX/ha/yr`, `person-days/ha`, `person-days/ha/yr`, `other` | yes, `vocab_units.csv` |
| `geography` | Country or sub-region within Africa | yes, ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 or a named region |
| `literature_doi` | The paper's DOI, taken from the record and never from the model | no |
| `detail` | Sample size, discount rate, study context, currency and year | no |
| `study_design` | `RCT`, `observational`, `DCE`, `meta-analysis`, `review`, `other` | yes, fixed list |
| `sample_size` | Farmers, plots, or studies | no |

Alongside these, every published row carries its origin on the second sheet:
record id, page, the sentence, a table reference where the figure came from
one, the verification status, and the value and unit as they stood before
conversion. Any number in the database can be walked back to a sentence on a
page without opening the pipeline.

Two things here are easy to get wrong. A cost means nothing until the
currency, the study year and the area are all pinned down, so all three are
captured as written and the arithmetic happens later in code. And person-days
are a quantity of labour, not a price: the pipeline refuses to monetise them,
because the wage assumption belongs to the financial model and not to this
review.

## 5. Keywords and search strategy

A query is a cross rather than a phrase. A record has to look like it is about
a practice and like it contains a figure.

```
practice term  AND  (cost term  OR  adoption term  OR  carbon term)
               AND  African country institution tie
               AND  publication year inside the window
```

The blocks live in `catalogues/keyword_list.R`.

| Block | What is in it |
|---|---|
| `KW_PRACTICE` | One group per practice code, carrying every spelling the literature uses: hyphenated, abbreviated, and local (`zai`, `tassa`, `FMNR`) |
| `KW_COST` | Terms that imply a figure: establishment cost, cost per hectare, gross margin, net present value, person-day |
| `KW_ADOPTION` | Adoption rate, uptake, dis-adoption, share of farmers, willingness to pay |
| `KW_CARBON` | Carbon revenue, benefit sharing, payment for ecosystem services, voluntary carbon market |

Three choices are worth explaining.

**Countries are not keywords.** OpenAlex can filter on the country of the
author's institution before anything is downloaded, which beats matching
country names in text for both speed and recall. It is also wrong sometimes:
fieldwork in Kenya written up in Wageningen is tagged NL. That is why
geography is judged from the abstract as well as from the metadata.

**A keyword should imply a number.** `cost per hectare` earns its place;
`sustainability` returns thousands of papers that discuss affordability
without ever quantifying it. Trial a new term alone with `--dry` and look at
the count before committing to it.

**The year window is not a question for the model.** It is applied afterwards
by `screen_rules.R` from the record's own publication year, which is why
extending the review backwards costs two edited numbers and a rerun rather
than a fresh pass over every abstract.

Each query is logged with the string sent, the filters, the date, and the
counts returned and kept, so the search can be repeated and the protocol can
report its funnel without reconstructing it from memory.

## 6. Setting up

**R.** Version 4.4 or later. Install dependencies once:

```
Rscript R/00_shared/install_packages.R
```

These are httr2, jsonlite, curl and fs for retrieval; pdftools for reading
PDFs; dplyr, purrr, tibble, tidyr, stringr, readr and glue for data handling;
stringdist for duplicate detection; openxlsx and readxl for Excel; ellmer for
model calls; cli for console output; rprojroot for locating the repository
root.

**Keys.** Copy `.Renviron.example` to `.Renviron` in your R home folder and
fill it in. That file is git ignored. `Sys.getenv("HOME")` will tell you where
it belongs.

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=            # screening, extraction, harmonisation
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=         # alternative provider
UNPAYWALL_EMAIL=           # required on every Unpaywall request
OPENALEX_EMAIL=            # optional, buys the faster polite pool
```

Optional: `SCREEN_MODEL`, `EXTRACT_MODEL` and `HARMONIZE_MODEL` swap the model
a step uses, and `CC4A_OUT_DIR` moves run output out of the clone.

**Folders.** Nothing to configure. `paths.R` locates the root from its own
position and builds the output folders when it is first sourced.

**On Windows.** Downloads are stored as `<record_id>.pdf` rather than under
the publisher's filename, because some of those filenames are long enough to
breach the 260 character path limit.

## 7. Running the pipeline

One script per step, run from the repository root. Each script's header states
its inputs, its outputs and its flags. Every step that calls a model can be
planned and priced first with `--dry`.

```
# 1 search
Rscript R/01_search/openalex_search.R --dry           # queries and expected counts
Rscript R/01_search/openalex_search.R

# 2 dedup
Rscript R/02_dedup/dedup_results.R --report           # what would be merged
Rscript R/02_dedup/dedup_results.R

# 3 screen
Rscript R/03_screen/screen_scope.R --dry              # price it first
Rscript R/03_screen/screen_scope.R
Rscript R/03_screen/screen_rules.R                    # audit, overrides, review queue

# 4 fetch
Rscript R/04_fetch/fetch_fulltext.R --dry
Rscript R/04_fetch/fetch_fulltext.R

# 5 extract
Rscript R/05_extract/run_corpus.R --dry               # plan and price the corpus
Rscript R/05_extract/run_corpus.R --limit=10          # a small real run first
Rscript R/05_extract/run_corpus.R

# 6 harmonise
Rscript R/06_harmonise/harmonize.R

# 7 publish
Rscript R/07_publish/export_results.R
Rscript R/07_publish/cost_report.R
```

One paper can be put through the extractor on its own, which is the quickest
way to see what it actually does:

```
Rscript R/05_extract/extract_verbatim.R outputs/04_fulltext/pdf/W2741809807.pdf
```

Steps 1, 3, 4 and 5 all remember what they have already done and append after
every record, so an interrupted run continues rather than restarts.

## 8. Where things end up

| What | Where |
|---|---|
| Raw search results, one row per record per query | `catalogues/search_raw.csv` |
| Per query counts, for the protocol funnel | `outputs/01_search/search_log.csv` |
| One row per study after deduplication | `outputs/02_dedup/records_deduped.csv` |
| Rows merged away, with the reason each lost | `outputs/02_dedup/duplicate_register.csv` |
| Screening: model verdict, reason, quotes, and the audited verdict beside it | `outputs/03_screen/screen_ruled.csv` |
| The manual review queue | `outputs/review/screen_unsure.csv` |
| Screening decisions made by a person, which outrank the rules | `catalogues/screen_overrides.csv` |
| Downloaded full texts and a note of which route found each | `outputs/04_fulltext/` |
| Extracted rows and the page verification audit | `outputs/05_extract/` |
| Harmonised rows, with the original value and unit preserved | `outputs/06_harmonise/extracted_harmonised.csv` |
| Terms the vocabulary could not absorb, proposed to the team | `outputs/review/proposed_vocab_terms.csv` |
| The Excel parameter database | `outputs/07_publish/cc4a_parameters_latest.xlsx` |
| Quality score against the gold set, and what the run cost | `outputs/07_publish/` |

## 9. Where the work stands

As of 22 September 2026.

| Measure | Value |
|---|---|
| Skeleton built, all seven steps | yes |
| Steps implemented | none yet |
| Practices in the vocabulary | 7, plus `other` |
| Units in the vocabulary | 10, plus `other` |
| Records searched | 0 |
| Records extracted | 0 |
| Gold set records | 0, still to be extracted by hand |

Next up: `R/01_search/openalex_search.R`.

The unsettled questions are listed at the end of `docs/protocol.md`. Two of
them block a full run rather than merely annoying: how to admit a
meta-analysis without counting its component studies twice, and which
deflator series to standardise currency against.

## 10. Growing the pipeline

**A practice.** Add a row to `catalogues/vocab_practices.csv` and a matching
group to `KW_PRACTICE` in `catalogues/keyword_list.R`. Rerun step 1, let steps
2 to 5 pick up only the new records, then rerun step 6 in full and step 7.
Nothing already extracted is read again. Walkthrough:
`.claude/skills/add-practice/SKILL.md`.

**A search term.** Add it to its block and rerun step 1. Downstream work is
keyed to records rather than to queries, so anything new simply joins the
pool.

**A wider timeframe.** Edit `YEAR_MIN` and `YEAR_MAX` in
`R/00_shared/paths.R`, rerun `screen_rules.R`, then rerun the fetch and
extraction drivers, which will collect only what the wider window admitted.
No abstract is judged twice, because the model's verdict is stored apart from
the year rule.

**A unit.** Add a row to `catalogues/vocab_units.csv` with its dimension, its
target unit and its conversion note, then rerun step 6 alone. The option list
has changed, so decisions taken under the old one expire by themselves.

**A schema field.** The costly one. Step 5 has to run again, because nobody
ever asked the papers for that evidence. Change `SCHEMA_FIELDS` and
`SHEET_PARAMETERS` together, and warn the modellers before the column order
shifts under them.

**A different model.** Set `SCREEN_MODEL`, `EXTRACT_MODEL` or
`HARMONIZE_MODEL` in `.Renviron`. Price the swap with `--dry`, and score it
against the gold set before believing its output.

## 11. Conventions

- Plain language in documents and script headers alike. Sentence case. No em
  dashes.
- Each script opens with a header stating what it does, what it reads, what it
  writes and what flags it accepts.
- Each script locates the repository root from its own position with
  `rprojroot::find_root(rprojroot::has_file("CC4A.Rproj"))` and then sources
  `R/00_shared/paths.R`. No script calls `setwd()`.
- Only `paths.R` knows a path. New output files are declared there before they
  are written anywhere.
- Analytical rules live in `catalogues/` and in `paths.R`, never inside a
  script.
- Look it up before asking a model, and where a model is unavoidable, batch
  the calls and keep the answers.
- Every extracted value carries a page and is tested against it. What cannot
  be found is dropped rather than kept on trust.
- Ambiguity goes to a review list, not into the data. Where nothing fits, the
  answer is NOT STATED and the cell stays empty.
- Rejected rows are registered rather than deleted, and the model's own
  verdict is always kept beside the audited one.
- Commits follow the conventional style: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`,
  `refactor:`.
